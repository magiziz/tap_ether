### Getting started

1. Download and install Xcode from the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) website.

2. Set Up iOS Simulator. Configure the iOS simulator via Xcode to emulate the app on your machine.

3. We recommend using `yarn` as the package manager. Initialize the project dependencies by running `yarn install` in the project directory.

4. Execute `yarn run ios` to build the project and set up the `ios` folder. This command also starts the iOS simulator with the project running.
